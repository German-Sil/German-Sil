- 👋 Hi, I’m @German-Sil
- 👀 I’m interested in the remote sensing, biogeochemistry, and biophysical processes of coastal wetlands. I largely focus on wetland landscape/spatial response to disturbance and ecological change 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to effectively code and use data from both remote sensors and field campaigns to assess and inform coastal management. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that look at coastal zone change and management.
- 📫 How to reach me: it is best to email me at german.silva@geog.ucsb.edu
