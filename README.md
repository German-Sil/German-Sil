- 👋 Hi, I’m Germán Silva
- 👀 I’m interested in the remote sensing, biogeochemistry, and biophysical processes of coastal wetlands. I largely focus on wetland landscape and spatial response to disturbance and environmental change. Currently, I am interested in studying coastal wetland soil salinity and the impacts it has on plants and biogeochemistry. Previous work has looked at plant response to drought, landcover change following debris flows, and soil property influence on plant establishment success.  
- 🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that utilize both remote sensing and field campaigns to assess and inform coastal management, restoration, and general understanding of coastal zone change, biogeochemistry, restoration, and management.
- 📫 How to reach me: it is best to email me at german.silva@geog.ucsb.edu
